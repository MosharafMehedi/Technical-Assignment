 Day 1: Clickable Mock-Up Creation
 
Create the three core interfaces—Signup, Login, and Chatbox—in Figma for your chatbox project.
Login Interface: Draw a centered rectangle for the form, add text fields for Email and Password, and a "Login" button below.
Sign Up Interface: Copy the login layout, change the heading to "Sign Up", and modify the button text accordingly.
Add link text under each form to switch between Login and Sign Up.
Chatbox Interface: Create a large box for messages, a top bar with "Chat Room" text and a "Logout" button.
Add a bottom text field for input and a "Send" button to simulate sending messages.

Day 2: Frontend Development

Develop the frontend of the chatbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
Inside the folder, create the following files:<br>
index.html , style.css , index.js<br>
This project demonstrates:<br>
HTML structure for forms and chat UI.<br>
CSS styling for a clean, modern look.<br>
JavaScript to handle signup, login, logout, and in-page messaging.<br>
LocalStorage for storing users and sessions (demo purpose only, not secure for production).<br>

Open the Project in VS Code or any code editor:<br>
Right-click on index.html and choose "Open with" > Your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).<br>
The app will open and display the login/signup interface.<br>
Test the features:<br>
Create a new user via the Sign Up form.<br>
Log in with that user.<br>
Type messages in the chatbox.<br>
Use the Logout button to sign out.<br>
No installation or server is needed:<br>
This project runs purely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
